# Deployment and CI

How OpenTakeoff ships: every change lands on `main` through a pull request,
and every merge to `main` is automatically deployed to production at
<https://opentakeoff.kentucky-ai.com>. There is no manual deploy step and no
"deploy later" state—**a merge is a deploy**.

(This file's mechanism description is accurate for this repo—it originally
came in from a downstream fork's own docs during the 2026-07-13 history
merge, which is why earlier revisions named that fork's own deployment,
`takeoff.345flooring.com`, instead of this repo's. See `AGENTS.md`.)

## The pipeline

```
branch → npm run check (local) → PR → CI (`web` check) → squash-merge
                                                             │
                                                             ▼
                                          Netlify git integration
                                          (netlify.toml: base web/, npm run build)
                                                             │
                                                             ▼
                                          https://opentakeoff.kentucky-ai.com
```

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every PR: `npm ci` then
  `npm run check` (typecheck → lint → tests → build) inside `web/`. This is the
  `web` check the branch ruleset gates on, and it is the ONLY gate—nothing
  re-runs it after the merge.
- **Deploy** is Netlify's own git integration, watching `main`. It builds the
  merge commit from source using `netlify.toml` (`base = "web"`,
  `command = npm run build`, `publish = "dist"`) and publishes the result.
  Nothing is uploaded from Actions.
- **Netlify is the only thing that builds production.** An earlier revision of
  this file said the opposite—that Actions published `web/dist` with
  `--no-build` and "Netlify never builds". That was true until
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` was **deleted on 2026-07-13 in `e701f1a`**
  ("deploys here are manual CLI; it fails on every push without the fork's
  secrets"). Only `ci.yml` and `publish-mcp.yml` remain. The consequence worth
  knowing: because CI does not re-run after the merge, **the PR's green check is
  the last gate before production.**

## Local/CI parity

CI failures that don't reproduce locally are almost always environment drift.
This repo pins the environment so drift can't happen:

- **Node version** lives in `web/.nvmrc` (one source of truth). `nvm use`
  reads it locally; both workflows read it through `node-version-file`.
- **`npm run check`** is the exact command CI runs—same order, same steps.
  Green locally ⇒ green in CI.
- **`npm ci`** in CI installs strictly from `package-lock.json`; if your
  lockfile is out of sync with `package.json`, CI fails fast rather than
  silently resolving different versions.

## Optional build-time env vars (team cloud mode)

The default build needs **no** environment at all. Turning on the optional
team-only cloud mode (Google sign-in + shared Drive) adds three build-time
variables, read by Vite and inlined into `web/dist` at build:

- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`—the public OAuth 2.0 Web client id.
- `VITE_GOOGLE_HD`—your Google Workspace domain (for example, `345flooring.com`).
- `VITE_PRICING_FILE_ID`—the Drive file id of the synced `pricing.json`.

All three are **non-secret public identifiers** and are meant to ship in the
bundle—there is no client secret or API key here, so unlike the Netlify token
they are not repository/environment secrets. They're **optional**: leave them
unset and the app builds and runs exactly as before (anonymous, local-only). Set
them as build environment variables wherever `npm run check`/`build` runs (or in
`web/.env.local` locally—see [`web/.env.example`](../web/.env.example)). Full
one-time setup is in [`GOOGLE_SETUP.md`](GOOGLE_SETUP.md).

## Rules on `main`

Enforced by GitHub branch protection (admins included):

- Changes land by pull request only; direct pushes are rejected.
- The `web` CI check must be green.
- The branch must be up to date with `main` before merging.
- No force-pushes, no branch deletion.

Merge with `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch`, then
`git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`. Squash-merged local branches need
`git branch -D` (git can't see the squash as a merge).

## Security model

- The Netlify deploy token is an **environment secret** on the `production`
  environment, which is restricted to protected branches—only a workflow
  that declares `environment: production` *and* runs from `main` can read it.
  It is never available to pull requests, forks, or other workflows.
- Fork PRs run CI with **no secrets** and a **read-only** `GITHUB_TOKEN`;
  first-time contributors need maintainer approval before workflows run.
- Both workflows declare `permissions: contents: read` (least privilege).
- Only GitHub-owned and verified-creator actions are allowed, and
  `netlify-cli` is pinned to an exact version in the deploy step—bump it
  deliberately, never float it.
- No token values, account identifiers, or rotation procedures appear in this
  repo. Account-level runbook details are documented privately.

## When something fails

- **CI red on a PR**: run `npm run check` in `web/` on Node from `.nvmrc`
  (`nvm use`). It reproduces the failure locally—fix, push, CI re-runs.
- **Deploy run red after a merge**: the site keeps serving the previous
  deploy (Netlify deploys are atomic). Fix forward with a new PR, or re-run
  the failed run from the Actions tab once the cause is external
  (for example, a secrets or config issue).
